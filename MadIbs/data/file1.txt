What's For Dinner?

It was Thanksgiving, and the scent of succulent roast (noun) wafted through my house.

"(person in room), it's time to (verb)!" my mother called.

I couldn't wait to get my (part o the body plural) on that (adjective) Thanksgiving meal.

My family sat around the dining-room (noun).

The table was laid out with every kind of (noun) imaginable.

There was a basket of hot buttered (plural noun) and glasses of sparkling (type of liquid).

The (adjective) turkey sat, steaming, next to the tureen of (noun) gravy

.A bowl of ruby-red (noun) sauce, a sweet-(noun) casserole, and a dish of mashed (plural noun) tempted my taste buds.

But the dish I looked forward to most was Grandma (person in the room female)'s famous (noun) pie.

Thanksgiving is my favourite holiday, (part of the body plural) down!
